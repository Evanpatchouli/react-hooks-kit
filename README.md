## Progress

There are about **60** hooks in library, most of them are still experimental and not stable yet. In menu, only the hooks without prefix tag is
entirely stable. If a hook with prefix tag of **new**, it means it has passed tests; with a prefix tag of **cup** means experimental; a prefix tag of
**clock** means in plan.

- When a test for a hook or a feature of a hook passed, the z in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
- When a hook pass all tests, it should be switched to **new**, and the y in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
- When a module of hooks pass all tests, the x in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
- After a module of hooks all pass tests for 3 decades, it should get retests, the hooks pass retests should be switched to **stable**.
- After a module of hooks all pass retests, and the x in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
- Commonly, when a hook passes the first tests, the z should be increased by 1. If a hook is complex, it could increase with a feature passing tests.
- If a clock hook switch into **cup**, the y in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
- If a new hook is created, the y in version x.y.z should be increased by 1.
